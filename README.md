# GitHub Search

## About
It is an app where you can search github users and view their data displayed in different ways like charts, etc...
##### This app uses GitHub API
- [Root Endpoint](https://api.github.com)
> For unauthenticated requests, the rate limit allows for up to 60 requests per hour. Unauthenticated requests are associated with the originating IP address, and not the user making requests.
